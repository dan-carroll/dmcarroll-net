**What is a Business Technologist?** I would say it is someone with a foot in both the world of business and that of technology. With an entrepreneurial spirit, I worked at a number of money-making ventures growing up. And I was always interested in science and technology.

High school found me studying electronics and making a number of gadgets. This led me into the U.S. Army as a young man and work as an electronics technician. Later I would find my way into the world of computers and programming. This led me into helping others with their computers and business use of same.

Working as a computer systems administrator and programmer I eventually moved on as an independent IT consultant. Clients were primarily small businesses and local governments. Work was as an ad hoc system, network, or database administrator along with general IT support, repair, and installation. This work led to opening a storefront with sales and service and IT consulting.

Still doing IT consulting for small businesses and application development projects. The story continues with additional details in my [About](about.html) page. Thank you for visiting.
